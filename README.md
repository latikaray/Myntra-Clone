# Myntra-Clone
Hey Folks! This is my First Project in Web Development.

This project is a replica of the popular online fashion platform, Myntra. Using HTML and CSS, I’ve recreated the user interface, capturing the essence of Myntra’s sleek and intuitive design.

<h2>1. Header</h2>
The top section with the logo, navigation menu, and search bar.
Also, not to miss the Favicon on top of the Website along with the title.

<h2>2. Categories</h2>
Different fashion categories (e.g., clothing, accessories).
   
<h2>3. Offers</h2>
Special offers, discounts, or featured products.
   
<h2>4. Footer</h2>
The bottom section with links to social media, contact information, etc.
